ASP.NET MVC
ASP.NET MVC is a web application architectural pattern and framework for building dynamic, data-driven web applications. 
It separates the application logic into three interconnected components: 
            1.Model
                :The Model represents the application's data and business logic. 
            
            2.View
                :The View is responsible for rendering the user interface and presenting data to the user. 

            3.Controller
                :The Controller acts as an intermediary between the Model and View.
